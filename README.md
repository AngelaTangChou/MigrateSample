"# MigrateSample" 

This sample app shows how to:
1. Load a local notebook
2. Create remote notebook at a URL on sharepoint (if it doesn't exist, it will be there)
3. copy contents of the local notebook to the remote notebook


Note any Todo's in the code.
Also:
No real error checking - need to handle auth errors.
